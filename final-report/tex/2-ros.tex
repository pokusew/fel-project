\sec Summary of Differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2

ROS~2 has better architecture and offers more features. Thanks to DDS, it offers fine-grained QoS. It supports
reliable communication in non-ideal networks. Furthermore, the ROS 2 client libraries offer better control
over code execution and threading as they support writing custom executors. ROS 2 architecture is designed with
real-time support in mind (TODO: footnote)

The following table summarizes the most notable differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2:
