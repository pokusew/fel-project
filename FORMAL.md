Real-Time application support for ROS2

	Intended for: Bachelor and master
	For semester: B202
	Supervisor: Ing. Michal Sojka, Ph.D. / sojkam1
	Department: Department of Control Engineering
	Study fields: Cybernetics and Robotics, Open Informatics

	Topic description:

		One of the announced features of the new version of the Robotic Operating
		System (ROS 2) is a better support for real-time requirements. It turned out
		that current situation is not as good as announced. There is now
		an ROS real-time working group dealing with that, trying to improve the
		situation.

	The goals of this project are:
		- Follow (or even contribute) the work of ROS2 real-time working group.
		- Port our autonomous car applications (Porsche Panamera, F1/10) to ROS2 and implement missing pieces.
		- Analyze real-time properties of the ported application, perhaps by using LTTng and suggest improvements.
