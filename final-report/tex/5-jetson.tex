\chap[jetson] NVIDIA Jetson TX2 Setup

In order to run ROS 2 on NVIDIA Jetson TX2, we needed to prepare an appropriate OS image.


\sec Initial Setup

The whole process is described \nl at \url{https://github.com/pokusew/ros-setup/blob/master/nvidia-jetson-tx2/SETUP.md}.


\sec Building ROS 2 from sources

The whole process is described \nl at \url{https://github.com/pokusew/ros-setup/blob/master/nvidia-jetson-tx2/SETUP.md}.


\sec Running the Follow the Gap Demo

After we set up the ROS 2 environment on NVIDIA Jetson TX2, we wanted to demonstrate its working.
Though normally one would not use GUI on NVIDIA Jetson TX2, in this part of project we did decide to try it.
So we prepared also build of the Stage simulator for TX2's Ubuntu 18.
Then we successfully ran the Follow the Gap application.

\sec Bootable SD Card

We prepared a bootable SD Card.

% According to the Jetson_TX1_TX2_Developer_Kit_Carrier_Board_Specification_v20170501, Section 2.4:
% A full size SD Card (J12) is implemented, supporting up to SDR104 mode (UHS-1).
% NVIDIA Jetson has 3-level boot process which is in detail described at~\cite[l4t_tx2_boot_flow].
